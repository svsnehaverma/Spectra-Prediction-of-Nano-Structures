# <strong> Spectra-Prediction-of-Nano-Structures </strong>
The proposed framework is geared towards optimizing design parameters that influence the geometrical dimensions of nanostructures, thereby providing valuable insights into predicting transmission, reflection, and absorption spectra at the nanoscale. This methodology significantly enhances the feasibility of analyzing complex nanostructure designs, with broad-ranging applications in exploring novel interactions between nanostructures and electromagnetic fields.

Regarding computational efficiency, the developed algorithm demonstrates a performance improvement of over 700 times compared to conventional Finite Element Method (FEM) approaches, especially in cases involving manual meshing. Consequently, this advancement lays the groundwork for swift yet thorough methods for characterizing and evaluating the optical behaviours of nanophotonic systems.
